### Snap Website

This  landing page is an implementation of a challenge by [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5) The starter files(logo and pictures)was provided by front end mentor. **HTML,CSS and Javascript** were used for the design. It took longer than expected to complete but it was my first time having a UI/UX template and then having to think and write the corresponding html,css and javasscript codes.

I understand this isn't a perfect code as such,I would appreciate tips and suggestions on how I can improve this code.
